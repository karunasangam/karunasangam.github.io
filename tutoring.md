I have over ten years of tutoring experience, as well as five years of classroom experience. I have worked with students from grade 4 through the college level, and am comfortable with a wide variety of topics. As a educator, I emphasize understanding above rote/procedural approaches to mathematics. I believe strongly that mistakes are an opportunity for students to learn the material more deeply, and I aim to help students see the beauty of mathematics at every level. My tutoring environment is one where students feel comfortable trying their best regardless of the outcome, and I make a point to encourage them to develop confidence in their own mathematical reasoning. My background in pure mathematics makes it easy for me to give broader mathematical context to the concepts I teach; I find that my more advanced students really appreciate the the math knowledge that I pepper into our lessons!
