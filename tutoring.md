I have over ten years of tutoring experience, as well as five years of classroom experience. I have worked with students from grade 4 through the college level, and am comfortable with a wide variety of topics. As a educator, I emphasize understanding above rote/procedural approaches to mathematics. I believe strongly that mistakes are an opportunity for students to learn the material more deeply, and I aim to help students see the beauty of mathematics at every level. My tutoring environment is one where students feel comfortable trying their best regardless of the outcome, and I make a point to encourage them to develop confidence in their own mathematical reasoning. My background in pure mathematics makes it easy for me to give broader mathematical context to the concepts I teach; I find that my more advanced students really appreciate the the math knowledge that I pepper into our lessons!

## Testimonials

		"Karuna is a very kind, talented, and patient math teacher. She was highly recommended to us by another family because she helped their child with algebra when they were in middle school. She worked with our middle school daughter for about nine months last year, and she helped her to markedly improve her foundational skills for algebra. Karuna was very patient with my daughter, and she was able to explain concepts in multiple ways until they were understood. She is also good at checking for understanding and helping students learn from their mistakes. I was also very impressed with the depth and breadth of her mathematical knowledge. Without any prior notice, Karuna was willing and able to give half of our session to my older daughter to help her work through challenging calculus problems. Karuna is also a great role model for our daughters. She is a caring person with a growth mindset, and she is clearly passionate about math. She enjoys teaching students how to think mathematically and use multiple approaches to solve problems, which can help them in so many aspects of their lives."

		"Karuna is such an awesome tutor! She helped two of our kids, who were struggling with their middle school and high school math classes and also can become quite anxious when it comes to math. Karuna was able to quickly figure out where they were having trouble and patiently instructed them until they understood the material. Her approach is just what our kids needed to feel confident in their math classes. Karuna was also flexible with her schedule and was great about checking in to see how our daughters were progressing. When Karuna found out that our youngest elementary schooler has an interest in math, she even pointed us to some educational games he might enjoy and sat down with him a few times to try them out. We canâ€™t speak highly enough of her!"

		"Karuna is someone who has been very helpful to our family. In addition to being a clear and reliable communicator when it comes to her availability, Karuna is talented mathematically. Direct and always encouraging with students, she is able to pivot from one math realm to another with great ease. She helped our children over the years with everything from Algebra, to Geometry, Trig and Calculus. She was a joy to work with!"
