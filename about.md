I am a Lecturer and PhD candidate in Mathematics at Rutgers University, studying under the supervision of [Dr. Kristen Hendricks](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~kh754/). My interests lie primarily in low-dimensional topology. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and completed my Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics at Bard College in 2018. In addition to math, I enjoy knitting, music, and the outdoors.
