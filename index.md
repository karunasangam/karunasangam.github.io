I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at Rutgers University, studying under the supervision of [Dr. Kristen Hendricks](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~kh754/). My interests lie primarily in low-dimensional topology. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and reside there currently. I completed my Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics at Bard College, as well as my Master of Science in Mathematics at Rutgers University. In addition to math, I enjoy knitting, music, art, and the outdoors.
